# xUnit - Python test microframework

This is simply a small parcel from studies in Test Driven Development (TDD), reading a very nice book: Test Driven Development: By Example. 

Thank you [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck) by done this amazing book.

it's a recommended reading to developers, even if you don't like Python or Java (inside this book too).

### How to run
I used Python 2.7.x and run in MAC OS, but it's easy:
```bash
python xunit.py
```

### Output
* 5 run, 0 failed
